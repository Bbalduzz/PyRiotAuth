## PyRiotAuth
updated riot auth flow to incorporate hcaptcha api endpoints protection

## How to use
- u will need a capmoster account and an api key (capmonster is really cheap, charge 10â‚¬ and u are good to go for a long time)
  - take your api key and put it in `<YOUR_API_KEY>`
- initialize the class `User` with the user credentials
